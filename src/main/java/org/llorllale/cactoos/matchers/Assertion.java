/**
 * An assertion that can be affirmed in tests.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Examples:</strong>
 * <p>
 * Testing a value:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     public void test() {
 *         new Assertion<>(
 *             "must match the string",
 *             new TextOf("string"),
 *             new TextIs("string")
 *         ).affirm();    // value is affirmed
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Testing an error (see {@link Throws}):
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     public void test() {
 *         new Assertion<>(
 *             "must match the error",
 *             () -> { throw new IllegalArgumentException("error msg"); },
 *             new Throws("error msg", IllegalArgumentException.class)
 *         ).affirm();    // error is affirmed
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the result returned by the operation under test
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @todo #18:30min Replace all uses of MatcherAssert.assertThat() with
 *  Assertion, and ban all overloads of the former in forbidden-apis.txt.
 *  We should also look into banning common matchers like Matchers.is(), etc.
 * @todo #67:30min Assertion should rely on mismatch description when forming
 *  error message (as assertThat does). Currently 'was' is being used by this
 *  class as part of description, it causes duplication of the word with
 *  Matchers derived from BaseMatcher, such as IsEqual.
